Login Authenticator to protect secure pages, uses cookies to track logged in users
Currently allows anyone to register, can be modified depending on situation

Version 0.5 (pre-actual release)

Written by Kevin Kubit

Currently working on a forgot password capability, needs for that are below:
*Require email on registration
*Figure out how to verify emails (send activation link upon registration?)
*Send temporary hashed link to email when users forget password which allows them to change it



Future functionalities wanted:
*shortcode for sessions to insert on protected pages
*Captcha or are you human detection for the register new user form
*templates to make it look nicer
*Add functionality to change password from a profile page
*modify to work as a plugin for wordpress so users can protect pages by login
